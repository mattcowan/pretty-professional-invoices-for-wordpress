4. Configure settings under **Invoicing > Settings**

## Usage

### Creating a Client

3. Set the standard hourly rate
4. Add the client's address
5. Publish

### Creating an Invoice

1. Go to **Invoicing > Add New**
2. Enter invoice title (client name or project reference)
3. Fill in Invoice Details:
   - Select client
   - Invoice number (auto-generated if left blank)
   - Period of work
   - Date of invoice
   - Payment due date
   - Status
4. Choose invoice type:
   - **Project-based**: Add projects with time entries
   - **Itemized**: Add line items directly
   - **External**: Use the main content editor
5. Add projects/items as needed
6. Publish

### Managing Status Updates

On the archive page (Invoicing), logged-in users can:
- Change invoice statuses using dropdowns
- Click "Save Status Changes" to bulk update
- View real-time totals and client breakdowns
- Sort by status, date, client, or amount

### Filtering and Exporting Invoices

The archive page provides powerful filtering and export capabilities:

**Filtering Options:**
- Filter by client
- Filter by status (multi-select checkboxes)
- Date range (from/to)
- Amount range (min/max)
- Search by invoice number

**Export Features:**
- Export visible invoices to CSV or Excel format
- Exports respect all active filters
- Files include: Invoice Number, Date, Client, Status, Period of Work, Payment Due, Amount
- Automatic filename generation: `invoices-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` or `.xls`
- Includes summary row with total amount
- CSV format uses UTF-8 with BOM for Excel compatibility

To export:
1. Apply any filters you want (optional)
2. Click the "Export" button in the filter bar
3. Choose "Export as CSV" or "Export as Excel"
4. File downloads automatically

## Customization

### Settings Page

Access plugin settings at **Invoicing > Settings**:
- Upload your logo
- Set contact information (email, phone)
- Customize "From" address for invoices
- Configure custom invoice statuses
- Set footer text

### Template Overrides

Templates are located in `templates/`:
- `single-invoice.php` - Individual invoice display
- `archive-invoice.php` - Invoice list and analytics
- `header-invoice.php` - Invoice header

### ACF-Compatible Helper Functions

For template development, the plugin provides familiar helper functions:

```php
// Get field value
$client = ppi_get_field( 'client', $post_id );

// Check if repeater has rows
if ( ppi_have_rows( 'project' ) ) {
    while ( ppi_the_row() ) {
        $project_name = ppi_get_sub_field( 'project_name' );
    }
}
```
